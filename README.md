# postcard

My final project from The Odin Project's Javascript course where I created a front end for a social networking site. 

Postcard is similar to Instagram in that it is an image sharing social network. However users can only post one image a day and a users feed can only be viewed chronologically. The idea behind this is that users will have to really think about what they post before they commit to it and because of this there is no need to algorithmically manipulate what is displayed in their feed. The user is free to curate it on their own by following or unfollowing people. 

I used this project as an opportunity to get more familiar with React and using hooks to manage state. I also used parcel for the first time instead of web pack as I felt it was more suited to a smaller project like this. I wanted to create a react app from scratch without using create-react-app to bootstrap it.
